# Purpose

The [semfindr] package has functions for doing SEM (
structural equation modeling) diagnostics, such as 
identifying influential cases and computing various
diagnostic measures.

# Workflow

Many of the measures for a case is computed by refitting
a model with this case removed. Instead of doing this once
for each measure, [semfindr] refits the model for at most
as many times as the number of cases, each time with one
case removed, store them as a list of SEM results.
Functions for deletion statistics will compute them from
this list. By saving this list of results, users can do
any further diagnostic analysis later without repeating this
time consuming process.

# Loading the Package and the Sample Dataset

First, we load the package. The sample dataset is [pa_dat2],
with variables `iv1`, `iv2`, `m1`, and `dv`, and 100 cases.
For conveienice, we assign [pa_dat] to a new symbol, `dat`.

```{r}
library(semfindr)
dat <- pa_dat
head(dat)
```

# Fitting the Target Model

Assume that the target model under examination is a path
model with two predictors, one mediator, and one outcome
variable:

```{r}
mod <-
"
m1 ~ iv1 + iv2
dv ~ m1
"
```

We fit the model by [lavaan::sem]:

```{r}
library(lavaan)
fit <- sem(mod, dat)
```

# Fit the Model *n0* Times

We refit the model 100 times, each time with one case
removed:

```{r}
fit_rerun <- lavaan_rerun(fit)
```

This example takes about 4 to 8 seconds. For larger samples
or more complicated models, [lavaan_rerun] supports
parallel processing by setting `parallel` to `TRUE`.

If this process is slow, we can seave `fit_rerun` by 
`saveRDS` such that we can load it for future analysis.

# Standardized Changes in Parameter Estimates

One intuitive measures is to compute the changes in parameter
estimates if a case is deleted, with the changes standardized
by their standard errors.

```{r}
fit_est_change <- est_change(fit_rerun)
round(head(fit_est_change), 3)
```

`est_change` will compute the generalized Cook's distance,
`gcd` using the parameters examined. `gcd` is analogous to
Cook's distance in multiple regression, measure the
"overall" change in the parameters if a case is deleted.

Let's examine the top five cases with largest `gcd`:

```{r}
i <- order(fit_est_change[, "gcd"],
           decreasing = TRUE)
i_top5 <- i[1:5]
round(fit_est_change[i_top5, ], 3)
```

We can also specify the parameters to be included. For
example, we may only want to compute the change and the
`gcd` only for path coefficients. See the help
page of `est_change` for the detail.

# Compute Raw Change in Parameter Estimates

The standardized changes in parameter may not be easy
to interpret. If the original units are interpretable,
we can compute the *raw* changes, that is, the changes
in parameter estiamtes if a case is deleted, not
standardized by their standard errors.

```{r}
fit_est_change_raw <- est_change_raw(fit_rerun)
round(fit_est_change_raw[i_top5, ], 3)
```

If desired, `est_change_raw` can also compute the changes
in parameters in the *standardized solution*:

```{r}
fit_est_change_raw_std <- est_change_raw(fit_rerun,
                                         standardized = TRUE)
round(fit_est_change_raw_std[i_top5, ], 3)
```

# Compute Mahalanobis Distance

One commonly used measure for identifying outliers is
Mahalanobis distance. [mahalanobis_rerun] can be used to
compute the Mahalanobis distance of each case on all the
variables used in a fitted model:

```{r}
fit_md <- mahalanobis_rerun(fit_rerun)
round(fit_md[i_top5, , drop = FALSE], 3)
```

Note that a case with large Mahalanobis distance is not
necessarily an influential case. Therefore, if time allows,
influence measures should be examined to avoid missing cases
that are not extreme but are influential.

# Compute Fit Measure Changes

Another set of intuitive measures of influence is to compute
a goodness of fit mreasures if a case is deleted. This can
be done by [fit_measures_change], which simply get any
fit measures supported by [lavaan::fitMeasures] from the list
of results in [lavaan_rerun]:

```{r}
fit_mc <- fit_measures_change(fit_rerun,
            fit_measures = c("chisq", "cfi", "tli", "rmsea"))
round(fit_mc[i_top5, ], 3)
```

The value is computed by $M_{full sample} - M_{one case removed}$.
Therefore, if the value is positive, the measure is higher
in the full sample. If the value is negative, the measure
is lower in the full sample.

The argument `fit_measures` is passed to [lavaan::fitMeasures]
to sepcify the measures to be computed.

# Request All These Statistics by One Function

We can also use [influence_stat] to compute the previous
measures. It calls [fit_measures_change], [est_change],
and [mahalanobis_rerun] (if requested) and then merges
their results into one matrix:

```{r}
fit_influence <- influence_stat(fit_rerun)
round(fit_influence[i_top5, ], 3)
```

One major use of `influence_stat` is to provide information
for the diagnostic plots introduced below.

# Plot Generalized Cook's Distance

To visualize the `gcd`, we can plot an index plot with cases
on the horizontal axis and the `gcd` on the vertical axis:

```{r}
gcd_plot(fit_influence, largest_gcd = 3)
```

It accepts an output of `influence_stat`.

Can set the number of cases to label, based on the distance.

```{r}
gcd_plot(fit_influence,
         largest_gcd = 3)
```

`largest_gcd` is used to control how many cases with
high `gcd` will be labelled. The default is 1.

# Plot Mahalanobis Distance

Similarly, an index plot can be computed on the
Mahalanobis distance compute by `influence_stat`:

```{r}
md_plot(fit_influence,
        largest_md = 3)
```

`largest_m` is used to control how many cases with
high Mahalanobis distnace on all the variables in the
fitted model will be labelled. The default is 1.

# Plot a Fit Measure against Generalized Cook's Distance

```{r}
gcd_gof_plot(fit_influence,
             fit_measure = "rmsea")
```

# Plot a fit measure against Mahalanobis distance, with bubble size determined by generalized Cook's distance.

```{r}
gcd_gof_md_plot(fit_influence,
                fit_measure = "chisq")
```

Can use circle_size to control the size of the largest bubble.

```{r}
gcd_gof_md_plot(fit_influence,
                fit_measure = "rmsea",
                circle_size = 30)
```

Can add cutoff lines

```{r}
gcd_gof_md_plot(fit_influence,
                fit_measure = "chisq",
                circle_size = 10,
                cutoff_fit_measure = 1,
                cutoff_md = 9)
```

Other influence plot functions also have these features.
See ?influence_plot for more options.
