Description: Sensitivity analysis in structural equation modeling using
    influence measures and diagnostic plots. Support leave-one-out casewise
    sensitivity analysis presented by Pek and MacCallum (2011)
    <doi:10.1080/00273171.2011.561068> and approximate casewise influence
    using scores and casewise likelihood.
