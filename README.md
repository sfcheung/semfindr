# semfindr

A find(e)r of outliers and influential cases in structural equation modeling
through sensitivity analysis Jek and MacCallum (2011). Unlike other similar
packages, the workflow adopted in this package separates the leave-one-out
analysis (refitting a model with one case removed) from the case influence
measures. Users first do the leave-one-out analysis for all cases, or
cases selected based on some criteria (`vignette("selecting_cases")`), using
`lavaan_rerun()`. Users can then compute various case influence measures
using the output of `lavaan_rerun()`. The functions were designed to be flexible
such that users can compute case influence measures on estimates and
generalized Cook's distance for selected parameters, on raw or
standardized estimates, and on any fit measures supported by
`lavaan::fitMeasures()`. This package also support various plots to visualize
case influence, including a bubble plot similar to that by `car::influencePlot()`
All plots generated are `ggplot` plots that can be further modified by users.
More can be found in the Quick Start (`vignette("semfindr")`).
