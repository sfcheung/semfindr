# semfindr

A find(e)r of outliers and influential cases in structural equation modeling
through sensitivity analysis presented by Jek and MacCallum (2011).

Unlike other similar
packages, the workflow adopted in this package separates the leave-one-out
analysis (refitting a model with one case removed) from the case influence
measures.

- Users first do the leave-one-out analysis for all cases, or
cases selected based on some criteria (`vignette("selecting_cases")`), using
`lavaan_rerun()`.
- Users can then compute various case influence measures
using the output of `lavaan_rerun()`.

The functions were designed to be flexible
such that users can compute case influence measures on

- standardized parameter estimates and generalized Cook's distance for
  selected parameters;
- raw or standardized estimates;
- on any fit measures supported by `lavaan::fitMeasures()`.

This package also supports various plots to visualize
case influence, including a bubble plot similar to that by `car::influencePlot()`
All plots generated are `ggplot` plots that can be further modified by users.
More can be found in the Quick Start (`vignette("semfindr")`).
